# Pokemon-battle-simulator

Pokemon battle simulator with *mostly* modern gen battle mechanics in place. Capable of playing PvPs and also playing vs. the computer.
NOTE: the simulation is only for 1v1s, so no doubles or no 6v6 style singles

Fully scalable: 
  - New Pokemon can be added into the "Pokdex" dictionary by inputting its stats.
  - New moves can also be added into the "move_info" dictinoary by inputting its stats.
 
 Notable exceptions:
  - Certain moves with unique mechanics are missing (ex. lightscreen).
  - Pokemon are assumed to not have EVs or IVs or natures.
  - Abilities have not been implemented.
  - The AI can functionally play; however, it is NOT fully optimized yet.
